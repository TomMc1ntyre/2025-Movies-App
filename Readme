MVC Architecture: Laravel is based on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, which helps in building large applications by splitting them into three parts: models, views, and controllers.

Model: Contains the logic related to the application's data, including schemas, databases, and fields.

View: Represents the user interface, including all components that the user interacts with on the web page.

Controller: Connects the model and the view, handling interactions between them. It processes user input from the view, communicates with the model to retrieve or manipulate data, and then updates the view with the results.


How it works

User Interaction (View): The user interacts with the web page (the view), such as clicking a button or submitting a form.
Controller Processing: The controller receives the user's input from the view and processes it. It decides what needs to be done with the input.

Model Interaction: The controller communicates with the model to retrieve or manipulate data. The model handles all the logic related to the application's data, such as querying the database.

Update View: The controller takes the data from the model and updates the view, displaying the results to the user.

This flow ensures that the application is well-organized and easy to maintain.


Routes/  Laravel what happens for each URL like /movies or /dashboard

app/Http/Controllers/ Contains the logic for handling the requests this is where you process data and return views

app/Models/ Represents databse tables (e.g. a Movie model connects to the movies table)

database/migrations/ File that defines the tables-what columns and relationship exists

resource/views/ The HTML pages the user sees
